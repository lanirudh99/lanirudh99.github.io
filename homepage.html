	Lucario (ルカリオ Lukario?) is a Pokémon species in Nintendo and Game Freak's Pokémon franchise. Created by Ken Sugimori, Lucario first appeared as a central character in the film Pokémon: Lucario and the Mystery of Mew, and later appeared in the video games Pokémon Diamond and Pearl and subsequent sequels, also appearing in various merchandise, spinoff titles and animated and printed adaptations of the franchise. Lucario is voiced by Daisuke Namikawa in Japanese, and Bill Rogers in English.

Known as the Aura Pokémon, Lucario can track energy called Aura (波導 Hadō?), which is given off by all living creatures and has the ability to sense it from half a mile away. Lucario is also featured as a playable character in Super Smash Bros. Brawl. Since it appeared in the Pokémon series, Lucario has received generally positive reception. It has been featured in several forms of merchandise, including figurines, plush toys, and the Pokémon Trading Card Game.
